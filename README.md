# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description
I built this project to demonstrate my ability to refactor code to include semantic HTML tags, accessible alt attributes, and logical ordering of classes/id's. I wanted to do so in order to make my website accessible to more people and to make my code eaiser to read/understand.

The original copy of this code was full of non-semantic tags on the html document. I went in and included semantic tags/accessible alt attributes which has made this website optimized for better search engine results, and now screen readers will work for the images on my site. I also fixed a broken link on this website's navbar, and I reordered some of the class/id information on some of the img tags.

During this challenge I was able to learn the importance of using semantic tags, and how it makes reading the structure of an html document a lot easier when you have them included.

## Installation
This project will be deployed on GitHub Pages and available to view.

## Usage
The code from this project can be used as an example of how semantic tags and alt attributes are used in HTML.

The content on the actual website of this project can be used to highlight the importance of having good search engine optimizaiton, having a good online reputation management, and having a social media marketing presence.
